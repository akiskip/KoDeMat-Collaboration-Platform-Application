KoDeMat-Collaboration-Plattform-Application
===========================================

3D Multiuser Collaboration Platform in Java
The KoDeMat Project offers an open real time collaboration software platform that enables multiple users 
to work together by sharing project specific information. 
Initially KoDeMat targets the logistics area where it offers a virtual 3D Environment for the collaborative planning and 
testing of material handling systems in logistics facilities.

The project was carried out from the "Lehrstuhl für Förder- und Lagerwesen (FLW) of TU Dortmund" and the Institute for
Materials Handling, Material Flow, Logistics (fml) of TU Munich. The KoDeMat research Project project (IGF-17391) of the Research Association BVL was funded via the AiF under the program for the promotion of industrial research by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology based on a decision of the German Government.
